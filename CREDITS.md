# Credits

This template is an extraction, not an invention. Most of what is good in it was
taken from somewhere, and this file is where that is recorded in one place
rather than scattered through the prose.

**If you add something borrowed, add its line here in the same commit.** The
same rule already applies to a skill and its harness router, for the same
reason: a credit recorded only in the file that happens to use the idea is a
credit nobody looking for it will find, and an idea that gets adapted and
renamed loses its parent silently.

## Ideas this template's rules came from

| What | From | Where it shows up here |
|---|---|---|
| The certainty ladder - grade a claim, name the level out loud | `blast-radius`, in Lauren Tan's **pstack** ([poteto](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack)) | `AGENTS.md` § Working Methodology |
| The skill hardening checklist | Paul Bakaus, *The Dark Arts of Skill Engineering* ([pbakaus/impeccable-talks](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable-talks)) | `docs/writing-your-own-skills.md`, which says so in its own Credit section |
| Six rules for prose | George Orwell, *Politics and the English Language* (1946) | `AGENTS.md` § Content Rules, optional |
| A verification lever plus a feature map - a CLI that drives the running app, and a four-heading file per feature | `create-verification-skill`, in Lauren Tan's **pstack** ([poteto](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack)) | `.claude/skills/build-verification-skill/` |
| The correction ladder - fix a repeated agent mistake in code first, then static analysis, then rules, then skills, and prose last | Lauren Tan, "how I shipped 2,500 PRs" (talk, 2026) | `.claude/skills/learn/SKILL.md`, `docs/coding-standards.md` |
| Coding standards read by a separate reviewer, not the implementer; navigation-miss, tool-economy and bloat captures; merge danger as a one-way or two-way door plus blast radius | Matt Pocock, "fixing the PR bottleneck" (AI Engineer Paris, 2026) and his [skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) `code-review`, `retro` and `pr` | `AGENTS.md` § Working Methodology, `docs/coding-standards.md`, `.claude/skills/learn/SKILL.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md` |
| Session-management habits - rewind over correction, new task new session, compact with direction | [Thariq Shihipar](https://x.com/trq212/status/2044548257058328723) | `docs/methodology/session-management.md` |
| The "second brain" pattern - a `raw/` corpus indexed for retrieval | Ryan Wiggins' Second Brain pattern, with index/log/lint bookkeeping after Andrej Karpathy's LLM-wiki notes | `brain/` |

The rest - the push gate, branch claiming and leases, the verification gates,
the mutate-the-suite discipline, the hook adapters - came out of the production
setup this template was extracted from, and were written there before they were
written here. Several were rewritten on the way in rather than copied: a rule
with its original example stripped out usually stops saying why it exists.

## Software this template depends on or recommends

Recommending is not borrowing, but a reader deserves to know whose work they are
being pointed at, and under what terms. Full notes on each, including the ones
that will tread on this template if you install them, are in
[`docs/recommended-tooling.md`](docs/recommended-tooling.md).
